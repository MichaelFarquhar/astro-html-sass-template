# Astro HTML + SASS Template

An extremely barebones Astro template for an HTML site with Sass. You can use this over the empty default template provided by Astro as this template comes pre-built with basic HTML layout foundation.

This template also includes [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/). It is linked in the head of the Base Layout.

### How To Setup

1. If you have not already, install the official [Astro VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.astro-vscode) for syntax highlighting, TypeScript type information and intellisense.
2. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/MichaelFarquhar/astro-html-sass-template.git `

3. Make any changes needed to **package.json**.

### Sass

This template comes with sass installed and all sass can be written in-line inside _.astro_ files.You can do so with the following syntax: `<style lang="scss">`
